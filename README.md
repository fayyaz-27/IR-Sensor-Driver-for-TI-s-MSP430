# MSP430FR5969 IR Sensor Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates interfacing an **IR sensor** with the **MSP430FR5969** microcontroller using **register-level C programming**. It runs on the **MSP430FR5969 LaunchPad Evaluation Kit** and showcases how to read digital input from an IR sensor and respond accordingly with LEDs or other peripherals.

The code is written entirely in C, without using high-level libraries, giving a clear view of how the MSP430's registers and GPIOs are controlled at a low level.
